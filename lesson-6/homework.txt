Task 1: Looping Over Files â€“ Importing Big Bang Theory Data
Objective:
Create an SSIS package that loops through multiple .csv files using a Foreach Loop Container and loads their content into the SQL table BigBangEpisodes.

Files and Tables
Source Folder:
Big bang theory season 7.csv
Big bang theory season 8.csv
Big bang theory season 9.csv
Big bang theory season 10.csv


CREATE TABLE BigBangEpisodes (
    SeasonNumber INT NULL,
    EpisodeNumber INT NULL,
    DateBroadcast DATE NULL,
    Title VARCHAR(255) NULL
);


Task Instructions:
Create a folder on your PC: C:\SSIS\BigBangData (you can use your path)
Place multiple .csv files there (e.g., Season 7, 8, 9 10 files).
Each file should follow the same structure (same as the uploaded file).

Create a package which loops over the CSV files (give files ...Season 7, 8, 9 10 files)) in the folder path, importing each into the table BigBangEpisodes to get the data 

You'll need at some stage to create an expression for the ConnectionString property of the flat file connection.  Note: you're not allowed to use the MultiFlatFile connection - that would be cheating!
